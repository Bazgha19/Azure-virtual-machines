## How to create and deploy Azure virtual machines

## Workshop Source 

We selected to create this workshop based on the following resources from Microsoft Learn Website:

Source 1:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-linux-virtual-machine-in-azure/

Source 2:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-windows-virtual-machine-in-azure/

Source 3:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-wordpress

Source 4:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview

## Stage 1: Desired Results 

1. Students will be skilled at: How to create and deploy various types of Azure virtual machines like how to create and delpoy Linux VM, Windows VM, Web App and WordPress VM.

2. Students will be able to independently use their learning to: create and deploy fully functional Azure VM and will be able to use them for real world problem solving.

3. Students will be able: to connect Linux and Windows VM with their local machines and will be able to perform tasks on VM's from their local machines.

4. Students will be able: to host WordPress website and can start their blogging journey, either by writing about tech or can publish about their favourite topics.

5. Students will be able: to create their online portfolio by using Azure Web service, which can help them to stand out among other applicants for jobs or internships.

## Stage 2: Evidence

 Students will demonstrate their understanding of the concepts learned by doing the following:
 
1. Short quizes about the concepts learned in each module.

2. Students can use Azure Sandbox or their student Azure subscription for practicing the concepts learned.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

## Pre-Learning

*[The link to Microsoft Learn for students to pre-learn the topic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-linux-virtual-machine-in-azure/2-create-a-linux-virtual-machine)*

## Prerequisites

[Read](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-linux-virtual-machine-in-azure/2-create-a-linux-virtual-machine)

## What students will learn

*In this area, describe the scenario and intended solution, paraphrasing what is in the module or creating a brief description here*

Example: We have an existing website running on a local Ubuntu Linux server. Our goal is to create an Azure virtual machine (VM) using the latest Ubuntu image and then migrate the site to the cloud. In this unit, you'll learn about the options you'll need to evaluate when creating a virtual machine in Azure.
